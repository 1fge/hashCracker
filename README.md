# hashCracker
hashCracker is Python program used to crack unknown hashes. Currently, it only supports md5 hashes and dictionary attacks with the rockyou.txt wordlist which must be in the hashCracker folder. However, I plan on adding more algorithms and implementing the use of custom wordlists in later versions.

# How to Install
To install hashCracker, download the hashCracker.py file and place it wherever you desire. Run with Python 3 and follow the prompts to begin cracking hashes. Ensure you have a good wordlist somewhere on your machine for hashCracker to use.
