# hashCracker
hashCracker is Python program used to crack unknown hashes. Currently, it only supports md5 hashes and dictionary attacks with the rockyou.txt wordlist which must be in the hashCracker folder. However, I plan on adding more algorithms and implementing the use of custom wordlists in later versions.
